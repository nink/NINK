# ‚å®Ô∏è NINK ‚Äì Next INteractive Keyboard

**NINK** (Next INteractive Keyboard) is a fully dynamic, full-color, interactive keyboard powered by programable interface. It reimagines human‚Äìcomputer interaction by replacing traditional static keycaps with a fully programable displays.

Originally conceived for retro emulation, NINK now supports a broad range of applications: emulation, productivity, gaming, AI-driven interaction, accessibility, and programmable control panels.
